When Hyunjoon woke up that Wednesday morning, everything was strange.

Not that his life belonged to the most normal ones that could be lived in the first place, but there had been some kind of “new normal” that had established itself in the past few months, that had become very dear to him.

The biggest part of this new normal was a certain someone octopus-hugging the living daylights out of him throughout the night and demanding attention first thing in the morning, before the alpha could even open his eyes.

So yeah. Waking up alone for the first time in what felt like an eternity, with only sunshine tickling his nose instead of a head of unruly black hair was decidedly NOT normal.

“Woojeeeeee”, he whined with a yawn, searching the narrow bed for his omega with all limbs at once, yet coming up empty.

No Wooje in sight.
